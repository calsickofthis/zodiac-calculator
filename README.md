This is my repeat project for my college course module - Internet & Mobile Applications
This app takes in the input of date and month from the user and runs a check on what the user inputted - depending on the date and month it will display the inputted date's 'zodiac sign' along with a description of what that zodiac sign means and the qualities people with that sign usually have.
